 * Write a method named daysInMonth that accepts a month (an integer between 1 and 12)
 * as a parameter and returns the number of days in that month in this year.
 * For example, the call daysInMonth(9) would return 30 because September has 30 days.
 * Assume that the code is not being run during a leap year (that February always has 28 days).
